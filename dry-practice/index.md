# Reset Trigger Kit for Glock

- Close enough for most training purposes

[The Reset Trigger Kit for Glock](https://www.glockstore.com/Reset-Trigger-Kit-for-Glock) from Glockstore.com is a training system for dry practice that saves you money each time you use it. Unlike other training systems, you have a real Glock, not something that’s “like a Glock,” so your presentation and indexing and sight alignment and slide manipulation and mag changes and general feel for the weapon all transfer over to your live fire sessions.

**Safety Note:** *Never* have live ammo anywhere near your training gun, or even in the same room. Having a completely separate training gun allows you to sequester it safely away from potential buffoonery. Even in a “safe” environment, though, always practice all firearms safety rules whenever you handle your training weapon.

You can drop it into a Glock you already own or purchase a kit that includes either a [Gen3](https://www.glockstore.com/Complete-Dry-Fire-Practice-Kit-G19-Gen3-3-Targets) or [Gen4](https://www.glockstore.com/Complete-Dry-Fire-Practice-Kit-G19-Gen4-3-Targets_2) Glock 19 and three laser targets for around $1,100. Considering how expensive ammo is these days, this will be a bargain if you use it a lot, and by getting the complete kit you won’t have to take apart a working gun to install the Reset Trigger parts each time you want to dry practice. Nothing encourages dry practice quite like having your dry practice tools just waiting for you to pick them up.

The trigger “feel” itself is a bit different than that of a working gun because the trigger mechanism is changed from the Glock design (where pulling the trigger pulls the firing pin back before release) to almost an Timney Triggers design (where the firing pin is already fully back, and the trigger simply releases it). Still, it’s good training for using the actual Glock trigger.

One habit you will have to abandon (assuming you are already doing dry practice) is cycling the slide between trigger pulls. Obviously, that’s the reason you buy the Reset Trigger, but if you have a couple of thousand repetitions of cycling the slide after each trigger pull, you will want to get out of that mode — especially if you have a magazine in the mag well (with or without a dummy round).

You can even practice Type 1 (failure to fire / click but no bang). Because the trigger is always ready to go, the trigger is never “tripped,” so to practice Type 2 (failure to eject / dead trigger) and Type 3 malfunctions (feed way stoppage) drills — everyone’s favorite — you will need to use an actual gun or engage in a bit of make-believe.

I highly recommend the optional laser “bullet” so you can work on your sight picture / sight alignment along with your trigger pulls. The laser bullet system from Glockstore has a nice bright orange tip on it to help designate this is a training weapon, which is good because the trigger is always in the “ready” position. I added an orange [Glock armorer’s half-slide cover plate](https://www.glockstore.com/Glock-Armorers-Half-Slide-Cover-Plate) to my training gun to further distinguish it from a live-fire-capable weapon.

There used to be inert weighted Glock magazines from CRTC and “half bullets” for standard mags to allow mag changes and slide manipulation without locking the slide back, but [Dillon’s Precision](https://www.dillonprecision.com) seems no longer to offer them, and I have yet to find another source for them. There are other options, though, including MagBloks, and P-Mags, and even Glock magazines.

Something that may confuse buyers is in the name. In a standard Glock trigger, there is an actual reset point. If you trap the trigger to the rear after firing, you can then let off the trigger just enough to reset the trigger for subsequent shots, as opposed to coming all the way off the trigger and fully stroking it each time. The reset point on the Reset Trigger Kit for Glock is less defined than the reset in an actual Glock trigger, and the timing of the reset does not seem as consistent as it is with a “live fire” Glock trigger. I’ve tried using the trigger reset, but have chosen to fully stroke the trigger each time. For me, trying to hit the reset point can result in either 1) short-stroking the trigger, requiring releasing the trigger again to (at least) the reset point before pulling the trigger again, or 2) going well beyond the reset point, obviating the point of the exercise. However, once you master the reset timing on the Reset Trigger, you’ll have it nailed on your live-fire Glock.

One surprising aspect about the Reset Trigger Kit was how easy it makes it to experiment with finding the right grip.

Caveats

single trigger pull probably best

with laser bullet, tend to correct by feel rather than by sights

My biggest complaint about the Reset Trigger Kit for Glock is that it even when the trigger is fully depressed the trigger safety still protrudes beyond the face of the trigger shoe. On the first day this is not a big deal, but when you pick up the gun the second day, you trigger finger will let you know how unhappy it is with that exposed trigger safety. Fortunately, with a little knowledge and a couple of minutes with an X-Acto knife, you can mitigate this issue.


Conclusion

Even when ammo was less than 18 cents per round, the Reset Trigger Kit for Glock made sense. Prices have come down recently, but at one point they were four times higher than that at 80 cents per round. At 80 cents per round, you easily could do enough dry practice in ten days to more than offset the cost of the entire kit.
